# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to crashing if the `:id` parameter is not a valid number or if the database query fails.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

**Problem:** The original code lacks error handling for scenarios such as invalid input or database errors. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**  The solution includes comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks to gracefully handle potential errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
